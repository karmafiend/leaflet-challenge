Week #15 Bootcamp Challenge - Repo for Chris Kilkes' Module #15 Data Analytics Bootcamp repository challenge - Chris Kilkes 05/20/24 @ 3:19 pm PST

# What the project does: 
The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. In this challenge, I have been tasked with developing a way to visualize USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet. This code enables developers to build an interactive dashboard to visualize the USGS' earthquakes global dataset which catalogs the depth, location, time and magnitude of earthquakes. Users will be able to view all global earthquake events as a result, spanning all quakes generated globally in the past 7 days on the visualization. 

# How users can get started with the project: 
Download code, tweak and modify as needed (i.e. selecting other timeframes from the USGS' quake dataset endpoint here: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php) and evaluate results for self. Code provides foundation for visualization of the USGS' global dataset.

# Resources used for building SQL project include:
Multiple sources such as: I referenced official Bootcamp course material and documentation; instructor teaching (classes & shared resources), aid from fellow students, Google Search, StackOverflow, W3C Schools, content as well as support and guidance from the Xpert Learning Assistant and ChatGPT. More specifically: I used Jeremy Tallant's previous Github code for this challenge, referencing his javascript code for the "Add Legend" functionality specifically (see Github repo here: https://github.com/JeremyTallant/leaflet-challenge/tree/main/Leaflet-Part-1/js); rdrr.io's Leaflet code examples and guidance (https://rdrr.io/cran/leaflet/man/addLegend.html) and Leaflet's formal documentation (https://leafletjs.com/reference.html) to complete this challenge successfully.
